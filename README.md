# Modern Go Guidelines

This repository contains guidelines for code agents that help them write modern Go code.

For example, an agent with these guidelines uses `max(a, b)` instead of an if-else block, `slices.Contains` instead of a manual loop, `cmp.Or(a, b, c)` instead of a chain of nil checks. It also knows about recent additions like `new(42)` to get a pointer to a value and `errors.AsType[T](err)` for type-safe error matching—both from Go 1.26.

The guidelines cover the most useful features from Go 1.0 through Go 1.26, including everything targeted by the `modernize` analyzer. An agent will:

- Detect the project's Go version from `go.mod`
- Use language features and stdlib additions available up to and including that version
- Prefer modern idioms over older patterns

## Motivation

All coding agents tend to generate outdated Go. Two reasons:

1. **Training data lag.** Models don't know about features added after their training cutoff. They can't use `errors.AsType[T]` (Go 1.26) if they've never seen it.

2. **Frequency bias.** Even for features the model knows, it often picks older patterns. There's more `for i := 0; i < n; i++` in the training data than `for i := range n`, so that's what comes out.

These guidelines fix both problems by giving the agent an explicit reference.

This aligns with the Go team's direction. The `modernize` analyzer exists to automatically update existing code to use newer idioms (see [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VePjjjV9JU) from the Go team). These guidelines serve the same goal for new code: agents write modern Go from the start, so there's less to fix later.

## Instructions

The guidelines are available for Claude Code.

### [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code)

For convenience, the guidelines are distributed as a Claude Code plugin.

#### Installation
Run the following commands inside a Claude Code session.

1. Add this repository as a marketplace:
```
/plugin marketplace add gsixo/go-modern-guidelines
```

2. Install the plugin:
```
/plugin install modern-go-guidelines-gsixo
```

#### Usage

The plugin adds the `/use-gsixo` command. Run it at the start of a session to activate the guidelines:

```
/use-gsixo
```

The command detects the Go version from `go.mod` and tells the agent to use features up to that version:

```
> /use-gsixo

This project is using Go 1.24, so I'll stick to modern Go best practices
and freely use language features up to and including this version.
If you'd prefer a different target version, just let me know.
```

After this, any Go code the agent writes will follow the guidelines.
